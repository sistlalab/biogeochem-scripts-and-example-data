# respiration/microbial biomass C, jar incubations
incubation and field respiration flux code

This folder contains R scripts for calculation incubation and field CO2 flux, (ugCO2-C/ g soil*time) as well as soil microbial biomass from substrate induced respiration (ug C/ g soil)

To run this code, you must always:
1) have recorded soil fresh weight (g) for your incubations and dry weight/fresh weight (gravimetric soil moisture) of a subsample
2) have at least three time points in yor incubations, run pseudoreplicates (duplicates of sample) incubations, had a  negative control
3)  make sure you data sheet is formatted exactly as show in 'biogoechem_example.xlsx'
